        <p>My name is Jillian, and I love to crochet! I’ve always been into arts and crafts, and I think crocheting has become my favorite crafting medium. The feeling of accomplishment that comes from finishing a project is super cool, especially after finishing something as big as a blanket, which happened to be my very first crochet creation! It was made up of nothing but single and double crochets, with big color changing stripes. That was quite an undertaking for a first project! </p>
        <p>It wouldn’t be until 2020 when I picked crocheting up again, but I decided to give amigurumi a try. After seeing some pictures of animals and figures online, I was determined to make a little figure of my own. I dug out my crochet hooks and some yarn, and got to work! I had to constantly pause, rewind, and rewatch the tutorial so I knew I was doing the right things, but the sense of accomplishment I felt after making my own little octopus was so awesome. In fact, I ended up making two more, right then and there!</p>
        <p>I love finding new projects to make, and taking on the challenges that may come with them. I also love that I have the opportunity to share my creations with an audience, online and in person! A handful of creations pictured on the website are available for purchase at Small Batch Kitchen in Lansdale, some being seasonal, others year round. I want to give a very special thank you to my boyfriend, Nicky, for putting this whole website together! He has given me the opportunity to showcase my projects online for the first time, and I could never have done this without him!</p>
