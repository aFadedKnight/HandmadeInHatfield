            <div class="Details WinterBGPartial">This penguin is too cute! The pattern is worked in continuous single crochet rounds with a color change, and a beak, wings, and eyes being attached separately. I love the look of a white belly, but you can always work this pattern in a solid color, too!</div>

        <p class="InfoText">I found this free pattern on <a class="WinterText" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtH25R-h9uQ&t=542s" target="_blank">Dream Crafts by Milia229’s</a> YouTube channel, and it makes for such a cute little winter decoration! I decided to make my penguin purple because that’s my favorite color, and I really like how the yellow of the beak pops against it. Although it’s going a little out of order from the video, I decided to make the beak and wings first and attach them while I was working the body up. That way, I could sew and secure those parts rather than trying to put them on after the body was all sewn up. This was one of my first projects that had a color change in the middle of a row, and it’s different from something that has color changes in a stripe formation. But watching along versus just trying to follow written instructions made the experience easier, and with enough practice, following the written instructions was no problem!</p>
