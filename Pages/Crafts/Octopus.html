            <div class="Details SummerBGPartial">This was the very first amigurumi pattern I followed! The octopus is small and consists of single crochet stitches and no additional parts to sew on. As a beginner, creating the tentacles was the hardest part of the pattern for me to follow. But I think it makes for a great introduction with back loop only stitches and working within them!</div>

        <h1>Info</h1>
        <p class="InfoText">I’m not sure why I decided to make an octopus as my very first amigurumi creation, but I followed along with <a class="YearRoundText" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OgSKL7JR0g" target="_blank">CreatOsaur’s</a> YouTube video to make it happen! Since this pattern was my first ever amigurumi creation, I was very limited on my materials. I embroidered the eyes on because I had no safety eyes, and I used excess pillow filling to stuff the octopuses. But I was so proud of my octopus army that was created! With each octopus that I made, I was getting more practice with the art of amigurumi, which would make my future creations easier to follow along with. Though I haven’t tried it, I’m sure this pattern could have long tentacles on it instead of the shell shaped ones. But I think the shells are a good place to start!</p>
