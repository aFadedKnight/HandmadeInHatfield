            <div class="Details WinterBGPartial">I love these little stockings! Made up of single crochet stitches and a few chain stitches here and there, they work up rather quickly, and there’s no limit on colors or patterns within. They make for fun Christmas decorations, or even a little money holder for a gift!</div>

        <h1>Info</h1>
        <p class="InfoText">This free pattern comes from <a class="WinterText" href="https://www.sewrella.com/mini-stockings-ornament-christmas-traditions-cal/" target="_blank">Sewrella’s</a> website and is also available for free download on her <a class="WinterText" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/mini-stockings-christmas-ornament" target="_blank">Ravelry</a>. When I made my stockings, I shortened the pattern in the foot and ankle area, but that’s just my preference! I made these as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend who attends Drexel University, and in order to incorporate both school colors, I decided to use the “sock” look. I’ve also made the “typical” stocking with the solid red/green with a nice white edge. With those ones, I like to add in a sherpa yarn to really give them that realistic stocking appearance!</p>
