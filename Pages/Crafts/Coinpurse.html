            <div class="Details YearRoundBGPartial">This coin purse is simple to make, and works up fast! Using cotton yarn, it's made up of a single crochet base, with the following rows alternating between a single and double crochet every stitch. The purse does require a bit of sewing to attach the clasp, but nothing more than a whip stitch!</div>

        <h1>Info</h1>
        <p class="InfoText">When I found this pattern from <a class="YearRoundText" href="https://hearthookhome.com/coin-purse-crochet-pattern-tutorial/" target="_blank">HeartHookHome</a>, I had to make it right away! She used cotton yarn to make the purse, which I used for mine as well. Acrylic can be used, but it might stretch out faster than cotton yarn would. With every stitch alternating between a single and a double crochet, using black and white yarn can make a houndstooth pattern! I've also made a purse with solid black yarn, and used rainbow variegated embroidery floss to sew on the clasp. Generally, I like to match the embroidery floss color to that of the yarn, but there are countless color combinations that can be used to give your purse a unique appearance!</p>
