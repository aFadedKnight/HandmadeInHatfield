            <div class="Details YearRoundBGPartial">These little guys always put a smile on my face! Believe it or not, the only parts that have to be attached are the horns and eyes. Everything else is worked in one whole piece, which is great for those of you who donâ€™t like to sew! Other than the frills and legs, this pattern is worked up in a continuous round of single crochet stitches.</div>

        <p class="InfoText">This free pattern comes from Club Crochet, available as a <a class="YearRoundText" href="https://clubcrochet.com/lessons/how-to-crochet-a-triceratops/" target="_blank">written pattern</a> or a <a class="YearRoundText" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FghEYGlfe9c" target="_blank">video</a> on YouTube. I think these dinosaurs are so cute and fun! I also made this triceratops as part of a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. Green is his favorite color, and this was the very first lime green triceratops I made! This pattern introduced me to two stitches I had never done prior; the picot stitch, which makes up the frills, and the bobble stitch, which makes up the legs. I really like how the frill and legs are all worked into the body and don't have to be attached later. </p>
