            <div class="Details SpringBGPartial">Nothing says flowers and sunshine like a bumblebee does! This little guy is made up of just single crochet stitches, with some color changing along the way. The wings and stinger are attached separately, but this bee pattern works up quickly and is super cute! I think this is a nice step forward for beginners, as it introduces light sewing work and color changing stripes.</div>

        <h1>Info</h1>
        <p class="InfoText">I fell in love with this pattern from KnitGrit the second I saw it! I was still very new to the amigurumi game when I made my first one, hence the button eyes and very chunky body shape. But the more I made, the easier it got and the better tension I had! I’ve made bees using black a very pale yellow, as well as a golden yellow with a dark brown. I really like the intensity of the gold and brown combination, but the yellow and black is a very classic bumblebee look! This pattern didn’t come with instructions for a stinger, so I decided to make my own. All I did was a chain 4, then slip stitched in the second to last chain from the hook down to the first chain. I think the stinger really helped complete the look of this little bee!</p>
