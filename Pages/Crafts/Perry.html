            <div class="Details YearRoundBGPartial">For all you Phineas and Ferb fans, this is the pattern for you! This Perry pattern is worked in a continuous round of single crochet stitches, with his back legs, beak, tail, eyes, and hair sprouts attached separately. There is some sewing required to make this pattern come together, but nothing too crazy!</div>

        <p class="InfoText">I found this pattern on <a class="YearRoundText" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqYyopRPppE&t" target="_blank">Azu Xolotl’s</a> YouTube channel. I wasn’t aware the video would be spoken in another language, but with auto translation closed captions, as well as close ups of the rows being worked on, it was easier to follow than I thought! I made this as part of a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, and being a Phineas and Ferb fan, he loved it! I attached the beak, tail, and legs onto the body before closing it up to ensure everything would stay secure and in place. I think my favorite part about this Perry pattern were the hair sprouts I added onto him. The pattern didn’t call for them, but I thought they would really complete the look!</p>
