            <div class="Details WinterBGPartial">The pattern for these trees was unlike others I’ve seen before. I loved the way popcorn stitches were used to make the puffiness of the tree, and I’ve used a handful of different colors to produce different looks for them!</div>

        <p class="InfoText">I came across this pattern by <a class="WinterText" href="https://www.youtube.com/@lydiashepel" target="_blank">Lydia Shepel</a> on Instagram. In her finished project, she made a solid colored tree and used beads to emulate decorations, with a star bead for a topper. I decided to use a solid color yarn with a strand of sparkly thread just to see what my end result would be, and I loved it! Using yarn with a sparkle strand already in it produces the same look, just a little bit smaller of a tree. But having a bunch all together with different sizes makes for a nice display! I was also at a loss for a topper because I didn’t have any star shaped beads, so I utilized some little jingle bells I had and the rest is history! Plus, they give the tree a little something extra.</p>
